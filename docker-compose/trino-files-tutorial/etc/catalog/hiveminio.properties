# To ensure SimpleAWSCredentialsProvider is used for S3A within Trino, we'd ideally rely on Trino's
# internal configuration or could try adding Hadoop config if problems persist:
# hive.s3.aws-credentials-provider=org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.SimpleAWSCredentialsProvider # This property was invalid for Trino 449
# It's better to ensure the S3A JARs are present and rely on keys/endpoint.
# Or use hive.config.resources with a core-site.xml as discussed previously for robust S3A config.
# For simplicity now, let's stick to these hive.s3.* properties.
